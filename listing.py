# for the listing it will be like this
vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']
# if I want to get one of them I will
print(vowels[0])
# The list or the index of the list start with "0" or u can use (-)

#Other method we can use is (slicing) its the to get more than one indivigual at the same time
vowles = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']
print(vowels[0 : 4])

#if you put number out of the range it will display (index error)
